    "The goal of this chapter of the thesis is two fold: 1) to extend AusEFlux back in time to the 1980's, and 2) to examine the interactions between a changing climate and Austalia's terrestrial carbon and water fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine 2), explore the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Long-term trends in NEE, GPP, ER, ET\n",
    "    - Trends can be diagregated by: bioclimatic regions, vegetation type, quantiles (0.1, 0.9), seasons.\n",
    "    - Calculate trends using robust regression i.e., https://github.com/mmhs013/pyMannKendall\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Seasonality:  \n",
    "    - Aus-wide phenology curve for 1982-2000; 2001-2022, has there been a shift?\n",
    "    - Does that shift match the shift in NDVI?\n",
    "    - Create annual (5-year avg maybe?) seasonality isolines. Lines of POS, EOS, LOS\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examine correlations between ENSO, IOD, SAM, MJO and carbon & water fluxes.\n",
    "    - Perhaps also consider shifting teleconnections using EOF\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Any changing climate sensitivity of the carbon cycle? GPP/NDVI NEE/rainfall? ?\r\n"
